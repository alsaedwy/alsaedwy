# Hello, I'm Alaa üëã
## _([Like Aladdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(name)); which is Alaa Al-Din) I'm just Alaa though!_

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over six years of experience, currently diving deep into the world of **DevOps**. I'm part of the Source Code Management (SCM) platform team at **Fidelity Investments**, where I work on streamlining and improving code management processes.

## üíº Professional Background

My journey in tech started with a strong foundation in software engineering, and over the years, I've transitioned into more specialized roles. Today, I'm passionate about **DevOps and MLOps practices**.
